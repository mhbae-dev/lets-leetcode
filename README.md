# Lets-LeetCode!

A Leetcode a day keeps the job interviews at bay

This is a personal repository created to document my journey of solving LeetCode problems. As a software developer, it is essential to have strong problem-solving skills, and solving LeetCode problems is a great way to improve these skills.

This repository is a collection of solutions to LeetCode problems in different programming languages, including Java and Go. I will be adding solutions to this repository regularly as I work through more problems.

In addition to documenting my solutions, this repository is also a way for me to track my progress and development as a developer. I hope that this repository can serve as a resource for others who are also working on improving their problem-solving skills or preparing for technical interviews.

Feel free to explore the repository and leave comments or suggestions for improvement. Happy coding!

## Why LeetCode?

LeetCode is a popular platform that offers a wide variety of coding challenges that are commonly asked during technical interviews. By solving problems on LeetCode, you can sharpen your coding skills, learn new algorithms and data structures, and gain confidence in your ability to solve complex problems.
